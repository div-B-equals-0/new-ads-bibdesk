An attempt to re-implement the core features of [[https://github.com/jonathansick/ads_bibdesk][~ads_bibdesk~]] but using the [[https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api][new ADS API]]

* Motivation
1. The current version of ~ads_bibdesk~ relies on Classic ADS, which is going to be turned off real soon (as of [2019-04-26 Fri])
2. There seem to be [[https://github.com/jonathansick/ads_bibdesk/issues/68][no plans]] to update it
   - They are waiting for ADS to allow access to API without requiring an API key
   - It is not clear this is ever going to happen
3. However, looking at the source code there are a million little details and edge cases that the current version handles
   - It would be a waste to re-implement them all
   - And I would never finish it
4. So, current plan is to work out just the minimum changes necessary to get it working with the new API

* What needs changing?
+ ~ADSConnector~
+ ~ADSHTMLParser~
  + This seems unnecessary if we are using the API, but maybe I am missing something
